A stylized, colorful logo featuring a stylized 2048 tile with the number 2048 in bold, modern typography. The tile should have a gradient background from deep blue at the top to bright teal at the bottom, with subtle geometric patterns. The number 2048 should be centered, white with a slight drop shadow, and surrounded by a faint glow. The background behind the tile should be a soft, light gray gradient, giving the logo a clean, professional look. The overall composition should be balanced and eye‑catching, suitable for a web app icon and splash screen.
